!Series_summary	"We report RNA-sequencing data of 2351 blood platelet samples, including 1628 patients with stage I-IV cancer (of which 18 different tumor types), 390 asymptomatic controls and 333 symptomatic controls. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsy' diagnostics for the detection and localization of early- and late-stage cancers."
!Series_overall_design	"Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 or 4000 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the humane reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq."

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing the EDTA anti-coagulant. The cells and aggregates were removed by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 120g, resulting in platelet-rich plasma. The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"100-500 pg of platelet total RNA diluted in nuclease free H2O was subjected to cDNA synthesis and amplification using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing v3 (Clontech, cat. nr. 634853) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Conversion and efficient amplification of cDNA was quality-controlled using the Bioanalyzer 2100 with DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent). Samples with detectable fragments in the 300-7500 bp region were selected for further processing and Covaris shearing by sonication (Covaris Inc). Sample preparation for Illumina sequencing was performed using the Truseq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr. FC-121-2001) or Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr.
